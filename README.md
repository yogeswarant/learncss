**learncss** is the result of trying one CSS code snippet everyday.

Thanks to [LevelUpTuts](http://leveluptuts.com/) for giving such a wonderful tutorial on [CSS](http://leveluptuts.com/tutorials/css-tutorials)  and [CSS3](http://leveluptuts.com/tutorials/css3-tutorials) for free.
Each video was short, crisp and clear. For beginners who are trying out CSS, it is definitely worth watching.
