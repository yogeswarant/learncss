    <p class="two">This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for
    the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also
    be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do
    not exist in the working tree anymore.</p>

    <p class="three">The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents
    of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working directory, and before running the commit command, you
    must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index.</p>

    <p>This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the
    time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run git add
    again to add the new content to the index.</p>

    <p>The git status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next
    commit.</p>

    <p class="four">The git add command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored files were explicitly specified on the
    command line, git add will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by directory recursion or filename
    globbing performed by Git (quote your globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The git add command can be
    used to add ignored files with the -f (force) option.</p>

    <p class="seven">
      This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads,
      refs/tags, and template files. An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD of the master branch is also created.

      If the $GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of ./.git for the base of the
      repository.

      If the object storage directory is specified via the $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY environment variable then the sha1
      directories are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

      Running git init in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite things that are already there. The primary
      reason for rerunning git init is to pick up newly added templates (or to move the repository to another place if
      --separate-git-dir is given).
